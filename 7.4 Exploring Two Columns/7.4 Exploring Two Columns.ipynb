    "Bar charts and histograms are useful for looking at one column at a time. But what if you want to compare two columns? To explore relationships between different types of information, we need to visualize data that includes two columns at once. In this lesson, we will learn how to use scatter plots and crosstab charts to analyze two columns of data together.\n",

    "A scatter plot is a two-dimensional way to show data, using individual points to represent the values of two different columns. It helps us see the relationship between these columns by placing a dot on the graph for each observation. The position of each dot is based on the values of the two columns, with one columns on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis.\n",

Conversely, if it slopes downward, it suggests that as the x variable increases, the y variable tends to decrease.\n",

    "To determine the trend line, we used the `numpy` library to calculate the coefficients of the line of best fit for the data. The line of best fit minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To draw the trend line, we used the coefficients in a one-dimensional polynomial function. We used the `poly1d` function from the numpy library to create the function. The `poly1d` function takes the coefficients as an argument and returns a new function that calculates the y value for a given x value. That function is then used to plot the trend line, using the `Admission Number` values as the x values.\n",
    "\n",
    "While trend lines are helpful for illustrating the general trend, they do not provide a complete picture. They can be misleading if the data does not follow a linear pattern. In this case, the data generally follows a linear pattern (with some exceptions), so the trend line is a good representation. However, in other situations, the trend line may not be as informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plots are an excellent method for examining the relationship between two sets of data. They can reveal patterns and identify outliers. If the points appear randomly scattered, there is no relationship between the two variables. However, if the points form a recognizable pattern, it indicates a relationship. \n",

A color map is a gradient of colors representing values in the table, helping to highlight the most and least common occurrences.
