This file consists of rows of data, where each row represents a dog breed, and each column (separated by a comma) represents a different attribute of that breed. The first row lists the column names.

The first number is the lower bound of the first bin, while the last number is the upper bound of the final bin. Each bin encompasses the space between two numbers. You can use this to create bins of varying sizes. For example, to use bins of size 10, 15, and 20, you can adjust the parameter to `bins=[0, 10, 25, 45]`. . Experiment with these adjustments and observe the results (note that there will be 3 bars since the bin edges are separated by 3 commas).\n",
