    "Welcome back to the second jupyter notebook of the series. In this notebook, we will be filtering and cleaning data to make it easier to work with. We will still be using the pandas library to help us do this, but first we need to look at the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time, we opened a CSV file and saw that it was a dense table of data. This time, we want to be able to see it a little more clearly. We will use an extension for Visual Studio Code called, funnily enough, CSV. This extension will allow us to see the data in a more readable format.\n",
    "1. Open the Extension tab ![Extension Icon](ExtensionIcon.png) on the right side of the screen.\n",
    "2. Search for CSV.\n",
    "3. Find the CSV extension with this icon: ![CSV Extension Icon](CSVIcon.png). \n",
    "4. Click Install. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the extension is installed, open the `Cereal Nutrition.csv` file. You should see a table of data that is easier to read than the CSV file. CSV files are not meant to be read by humans, so this extension is very helpful.\n",

    "1. [Click here to open the data on Google Sheets.](https://learn.mycode.run/link/xxcpx) Take a look through the data.\n",
    "2. From the `File` menu, choose `Download` then `Comma Separated Values (.csv)` to download all of the data.\n",
    "3. Open the Explorer tab ![Explorer Icon](ExplorerIcon.png) on the right side of the screen and drag the CSV file into the same folder as this jupyer notebook (`9.3 Filtering and Cleaning Data`).\n",

Instead of modifying the data you have, you only ever want to modify a **COPY** of that data. That way you can always go back and show the changes you made and verify that you didn't change the meaning of the data. Let's make that copy.\n",
