    "You've seen how to clean data manually, but what if you have a lot of data? It can be very time-consuming to clean it all by hand. Fortunately, pandas can assist you in cleaning data automatically. The `loc` function can be used to change the values it has filtered. For example, if you wanted to change the `Grade`s to be `Freshman` instead of `9`, you can search the data for `9` and replace it with `Freshman`. The code to do this is `classInfo.loc[(classInfo['Grade'] == 9), 'Grade'] = 'Freshman'`. It is important to limit the columns loc gives you to only the `Grade` column; otherwise, you might change the wrong column or all of the columns to `Freshman`.\n",
